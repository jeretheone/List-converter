# List-converter
Converts lists on python into string.
Please don't test the limits of this code. It's the first i have put onto here
You can download the file and then import the function.
Note: To get the converted form note that you need to store it in a variable
Eg, 
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
z = convert(x)
print(z)
result --> 1, 2, 3, 4
